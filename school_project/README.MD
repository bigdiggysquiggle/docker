My school's Docker project was essentially a crash course in
the basics of working with Docker. It consisted of 2 main
parts and a bonus part. In the first part (part 00) we were
asked to figure out a series of commands for things like
creating and managing containers, clusters, networks, and
volumes. In the second part we created a series of Dockerfiles
to familiarize ourselves with the syntax and featureset. The
third optional part was a bonus where we created our own
original Dockerfile. Mine runs DOOM.
