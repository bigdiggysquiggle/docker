This is where I'm going to be keeping all of my personal
Docker related projects. As I continue learning more and more,
these projects will become more and more advanced. For now, to
refamiliarize myself with how Docker works (and so I can learn
how to use Kubernetes), I'm going to be creating a Dockerized
Minecraft server from scratch. I know there is already an
image available for this purpose, but if I just used that
image I would miss out on learning the details of how a server
needs to be set up.
