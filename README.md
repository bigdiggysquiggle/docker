This project was done as an introduction to some networking and automation tools along with containers and
containerization by making us complete a number of challenges using the tools docker makes available to us.
As a bonus, I created a container that's capable of running doom when built and ran properly.

I've since turned this repo into a general location where I can keep my docker projects. I may eventually
split this into sub repos but in the meantime the convenience of having all my docker projects in one place
is really nice.

The DOOM container can be found in schoolprojects/02_bonus
